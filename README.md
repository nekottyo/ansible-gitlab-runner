GitLab Runner [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/eRadical/ansible-gitlab-runner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eRadical/ansible-gitlab-runner) [![Ansible Role](https://img.shields.io/ansible/role/3078.svg)](https://github.com/eRadical/ansible-gitlab-runner)
=============

This role will install the [official GitLab Runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner)
(fork from [DBLaci](https://github.com/DBLaci/ansible-gitlab-runner), which forked it from [riemers](https://github.com/riemers/ansible-gitlab-runner), which in turn forked it from [haroldb](https://github.com/haroldb/ansible-gitlab-runner)) with updates. Needed something simple and working, this did the trick for me. Open for changes though.

# NOTE:
Even though it's a fork it is *NOT* backward compatible:
- it will only install gitlab-runner (all "gitlab-multi-runner" references were scraped)
- all per-runner global variables were removed
- there is no "default runner"
- there is a list of runner to be configured (1 machine can have more than 1 runner... *be bold*)


Requirements
------------

This role requires Ansible 2.0 or higher.

Role Variables
--------------

`gitlab_runner_concurrent`
The maximum number of jobs to run concurrently.
Defaults to the number of processor cores.

`gitlab_check_interval`
The interval of job poll in seconds
Defaults to the upstream default (3 seconds)

`gitlab_runner_list`
This list will hold the multiple runners. It is a list of dict based on the settings available in one runner. You must set different descriptions for the runners to work.

# NOTE:
Runners are created for the first time. You can't change the settings of existsing ones with this role.

See the [config for more options](https://github.com/eRadical/ansible-gitlab-runner/blob/master/tasks/register-runner.yml)
